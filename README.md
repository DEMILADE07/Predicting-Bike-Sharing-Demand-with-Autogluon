# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-Autogluon
In this project, we'll use the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. I will be using Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In the end, I will submit several entries to the competition and achieve a rank within Kaggle. I will also complete a report of my findings that I can share publicly on Kaggle or my personal page.

You can see my thought process in the report-template file.
